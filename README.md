Sentiment Analysis of Twitter Data using DistilBERT
This project demonstrates the application of deep learning for sentiment analysis, specifically classifying tweets into positive and negative sentiment categories. It leverages the DistilBERT model, a smaller and faster variant of BERT, renowned for its efficiency in text classification tasks.

Key Features
Data: Utilizes a substantial dataset from Kaggle containing 1.6 million tweets, pre-processed and labeled for sentiment analysis. Model: Employs the DistilBERT model from Hugging Face Transformers, fine-tuned for sentiment classification. Training: Fine-tunes DistilBERT using the training dataset, adapting it specifically to the task of sentiment analysis. Evaluation: Assesses the model's performance using metrics like accuracy and F1-score, providing insights into its effectiveness. Deployment (Optional): Offers a simple UI using Gradio for real-time sentiment prediction, allowing users to interact with the model directly. Technologies Used
Python: The core programming language for the project. DistilBERT: A powerful transformer-based model for natural language processing. Hugging Face Transformers: A library providing easy access to pre-trained models and tools for fine-tuning. Datasets (Hugging Face): A library for managing and processing large datasets efficiently. PyTorch: A deep learning framework used for building and training the model. Pandas: Used for data manipulation and analysis. Scikit-learn: Used for model evaluation and data splitting. Wordcloud: For visualizing the frequent words in the dataset. Seaborn & Matplotlib: For creating visualizations and data exploration. Gradio (Optional): For creating a user interface for the model. Kaggle API: For accessing and downloading the dataset. Getting Started
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git Use code with caution Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt Use code with caution Download the dataset:
You'll need a Kaggle account and API key. Place your kaggle.json file in the project directory or follow the instructions in the notebook to upload it. Run the Kaggle dataset download code in the notebook. Run the Jupyter notebook:
Open the notebook (sentiment_analysis.ipynb) and run the cells to train and evaluate the model. If desired, launch the Gradio UI for interactive prediction. Project Structure
